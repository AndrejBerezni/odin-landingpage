# odin-landingpage

This page was created as part of **THE ODIN PROJECT** curriculum. I was following Full-Stack JavaScript path.

Goal for this project was to create a page from a given design - you may find it in images/design.jpg.

Copy was not supposed to be pixel-perfect and not all units were given, so sizes of some elements might be different than on the design image. I have also modified some sizes to my liking.

I have used HTML and CSS only.

Thank you for checking out my page!
